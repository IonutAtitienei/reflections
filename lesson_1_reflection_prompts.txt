How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?

    
It reduced grately the time needed to identify the bug.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

    
It could help me to have a better view at my code and to find easier and faster a older version of my files, when needed.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
I think its better because i dont need to clutter myself with unwanted saved files but it could help in case i forgot to save my work.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
I think its because files like html and css that are needed to run together in one commit.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   
I can use the git log to see different commitments that i made and the diff to see the different lines of code in those commitments in order to identify a bug or to see what i did wrong.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

    
It gives me more confidence knowing that i can learn without fearing i may lose the work or the hours i spent.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    
I cant wait to get started working with Git and Github!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It could save me a lot of time trying to find an older file and would help me work without fearing i would make a mistake without taking a lot of time trying to rapair it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It helps me keep only relevant versions of my files. Automatically saving my files would clutter my workspace.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because in Google Docs you usually dont have files that are conected like we have in html with css.
