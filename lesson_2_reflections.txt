What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It starts version control of my files using Git. I need it to review my las entries

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Stagging area is keeping track of the commits i make. It offers me data about the changes i make in my files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By using git diff to see the modified files
